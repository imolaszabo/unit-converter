In this project I have further practiced CSS and JS skills I have aquired so far.
I have added responsive growing for the input field, in case the user is entering large numbers.
I have handled the situation, if they enter a comma for fractional numbers or accidental letters, as well as if previously entered number is being extended, I am clearing the output.
All these additional stretch goals were added after I gave the app for a user for testing and he came back with requests that I haven't thought of initially.
